# Introduction to NodeJS

### What is NodeJS?
According to the official Documentation:
> _"NodeJS is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime envrionment. 
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project! NodeJS runs the V8 
JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This 
allows NodeJS to be very performant."_

**The V8 Engine:**  
NodeJS utilizes the V8 engine, developed by Google for the Chrome browser, 
to execute JavaScript code. The V8 engine compiles JavaScript directly to 
machine code, making it extremely fast and efficient. By leveraging V8, 
NodeJS allows developers to use JavaScript for server-side scripting, 
creating scalable, high-performance applications.
