## Exercise 1
  1. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and 
  print them in reverse order with a space between them.

### Ex1: Solution
  - [Problem 1 Python Script Solution](./solutions/1-reverse_name.py)

## Exercise 2
  2. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value 
  of **n+nn+nnn**.  

  ```text
  Sample value of n is 5
  Expected Result: 615
  ```

### Ex2: Solution
  - [Problem 2 Python Script Solution](./solutions/2-n_computation.py)

## Exercise 3
  3. Write a Python program to print the following document:  
  **Sample string:**  
  a string that you "don't" have to escape  
  This  
  is a ...... multi-line  
  heredoc string --------> example

### Ex3: Solution
  - [Problem 3 Python Script Solution](./solutions/3-print_document.py)

## Exercise 4
  4. Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6.

### Ex4: Solution
  - [Problem 4 Python Script Solution](./solutions/4-sphere_volume.py)

## Exercise 5
  5. Write a Python program that will accept the base and height of a triangle 
  and compute the area.

### Ex5: Solution
  - [Problem 5 Python Script Solution](./solutions/5-triangle_area.py)

## Exercise 6
  6. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested 
  for loop.  
  **Search about end="" method**

  ```bash
  *
  **
  ***
  ****
  *****
  ****
  ***
  **
  *
  ```

### Ex6: Solution

## Exercise 7
  7. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.

### Ex7: Solution
  - [Problem 7 Python Script Solution](./solutions/7-word_reverse.py)

## Exercise 8
  8. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 
  and 6.

### Ex8: Solution
  - [Problem 8 Python Script Solution](./solutions/8-except_3_6.py)

## Exercise 9
  9. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.  
  _Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...._  
  Every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.  
  **Expected Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 24**

### Ex9: Solution
  - [Problem 9 Python Script Solution](./solutions/9-fib_series.py)

## Exercise 10
  10. Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of 
  digits and letters.

### Ex10: Solution
  - [Problem 10 Python Script Solution](./solutions/10-count_digits_letters.py
